The 2017<span> </span><em>U.S. National Security Strategy</em><span> </span>declared:</p>\n<p><em>After being dismissed as a phenomenon of an earlier century, great power competition returned. China and Russia began to reassert their influence regionally and globally. . . They are contesting our geopolitical advantages and trying to change the international order in their favor.<sup><a name=\"_ednref1\" href=\"https://www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2018/05/15/a_competitive_strategy_to_counter_russian_aggression_113447.html#_edn1\">[i]</a></sup></em></p>\n<p>Building off the concept of a renewed great power competition, the<span> </span><em>U.S. National Defense Strategy</em><span> </span>took a broad view of the necessary actions to ensure national security:</p>\n<p><em>A long-term strategic competition requires the seamless integration of multiple elements of national power—diplomacy, information, economics, finance, intelligence, law enforcement and military. More than any other nation, America can expand the competitive space, seizing the initiative to challenge our competitors where we possess advantages and they lack strength.<sup><a name=\"_ednref2\" href=\"https://www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2018/05/15/a_competitive_strategy_to_counter_russian_aggression_113447.html#_edn2\">[ii]</a></sup></em></p>\n<p>What the<span> </span><em>National Defense Strategy</em><span> </span>calls for, in essence, is a Competitive Strategy. This is an approach developed by the Pentagon’s Office of Net Assessment in the late 1970s to construct a long-term strategy for managing the military threat posed by the Soviet Union.<sup><a name=\"_ednref3\" href=\"https://www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2018/05/15/a_competitive_strategy_to_counter_russian_aggression_113447.html#_edn3\"><span><span>[iii]</span></span></a></sup></p>\n<p>The main steps in the Competitive Strategies process are: 1) the identification and evaluation of the enduring strengths and weaknesses of both sides; 2) the alignment of one side’s enduring strengths against the other’s areas of weakness, and; 3) the identification of specific actions that one side can employ to exploit their strengths against the adversary’s weakness.</p>\n<p>This study seeks to support the visions articulated in the<span> </span><em>National Security Strategy</em><span> </span>and<span> </span><em>National Defense Strategy</em><span> </span>by developing a Competitive Strategy that can be employed to counter Russian aggression against the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). It identifies areas of comparative Western strength and Russian weakness.</p>\n<p>It also identifies policies, mechanisms<span> </span>and<span> </span>investments that the U.S. and NATO should pursue to position strengths against weaknesses, thereby enabling the West to compete more effectively against Russia.</p>\n<p>The current competition between the U.S./NATO and Russia is fundamentally different from that of the Cold War decades. So too is the international environment in which it is taking place and the relative power of the competitors. Hence, the U.S. needs a new approach to confront the Russian threat to NATO.</p>\n<p>A new strategy for the long-term competition with Russia must address the relative prominence of hybrid operations in Russia’s strategy while simultaneously responding to the marked improvements in its conventional military forces and the evolution of Moscow’s views regarding escalation to nuclear use. The West faces a multi-faceted threat from an adversary militarily weaker than its Soviet ancestor and more vulnerable to economic pressure, but seemingly much more capable of wielding non-military instruments of state power.</p>\n<p>Russia today suffers from a range of strategic weaknesses or vulnerabilities that can be addressed in a long-term Competitive Strategy. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Chronic economic stagnation</li>\n<li>An increasingly authoritarian political system</li>\n<li>A small number of weak or dysfunctional allies</li>\n<li>A conventional military with limited capabilities and excessive ambitions</li>\n<li>Difficulties pursuing advanced military technologies</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is important to recognize that NATO’s and the U.S’ challenge is not from any particular element of Russian power. Rather, it is to defeat Putin’s strategy to disrupt the current international security system by denying Moscow the ability to disrupt this order at minimum risk and an acceptable price.</p>\n<p>It is a mistake to view the current struggle between Russia and the Western allies primarily as a military competition. Certainly, attention must be paid to NATO’s ability to deter Moscow. But if Russia is denied the possibility of a quick, low-cost military campaign, then the competition will be decided on other battlefields. It is in these other domains that the U.S. and its allies have the advantage and are likely to prevail.</p>\n<p>The primary competition should be in areas of Western strength and Russian weakness: economics, information operations, rule of law, the global banking system and advanced technology, such as commercial information technology (IT). The U.S. and its allies need to coordinate strategies to deny Russian access to investment resources and commercial technologies for its oil and gas industry.</p>\n<p>The U.S. and NATO must compete with Russia in the conventional and nuclear military spheres. It must be made clear to Russia that it will never have a route to a quick and easy conventional victory against NATO, nor a credible option to escalate to the use of nuclear weapons without the certainty of retaliation. NATO needs a well-funded program to counter Russian investments in anti-access/area denial capabilities, particularly its integrated air defense. NATO needs to exploit its advantage in naval forces.</p>\n<p>Air and missile defenses are a necessary component of a NATO Competitive Strategy. Russian leadership continues to be concerned with the potential for defenses to complicate its ability to execute high intensity disarming strikes against NATO. The U.S. and its allies need to exploit these concerns by deploying additional air and missile defenses.</p>\n<p>Electronic warfare (EW) and cyber need to be priority areas for investment in a Competitive Strategy to counter Russia. EW assets should be directed at negating Russian air defense sensors, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) assets and communications, command<span> </span>and<span> </span>control systems.</p>\n<p>The U.S. and NATO need an information operations strategy that not only defends networks and institutions from attack but also conducts offensive actions against Russia. The Russian leadership is vulnerable to an information operations campaign designed to split them from the people.</p>\n<p>Finally, the U.S and its allies must be willing to engage in a long-term competitive campaign to its technological advantage vis-à-vis Russia. Investments need to be made in areas such as robotics, artificial intelligence and autonomy,<span> </span>hypersonics, directed energy, electronic warfare and cyber.</p>\n<p>NATO needs to focus not just on science and technology, but also on related industrial capabilities that will support high quantity production of advanced weapons systems. It is in the latter area that the West has a distinct advantage over Russia.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.lexingtoninstitute.org/competitive-strategy-counter-russian-aggression-nato/\"><strong>Click here for the full report</strong></a>.</p>\n<h3>Notes:</h3>\n<p><a name=\"_edn1\" href=\"https://www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2018/05/15/a_competitive_strategy_to_counter_russian_aggression_113447.html#_ednref1\"><span><span>[i]</span></span></a><span> </span><a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/NSS-Final-12-18-2017-0905.pdf\">https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/NSS-Final-12-18-2017-0905.pdf</a></p>\n<p><a name=\"_edn2\" href=\"https://www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2018/05/15/a_competitive_strategy_to_counter_russian_aggression_113447.html#_ednref2\"><span><span>[ii]</span></span></a><span> </span><a href=\"https://www.defense.gov/Portals/1/Documents/pubs/2018-National-Defense-Strategy-Summary.pdf\">https://www.defense.gov/Portals/1/Documents/pubs/2018-National-Defense-Strategy-Summary.pdf</a></p>\n<p><a name=\"_edn3\" href=\"https://www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2018/05/15/a_competitive_strategy_to_counter_russian_aggression_113447.html#_ednref3\"><span><span>[iii]</span></span></a><span> </span><a href=\"https://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA301844\">https://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA301844</a></p><p id=\"author-bio\"/></div></div><img style=\"height : 1px; width : 1px;\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"https://assets.realclear.com/images/44/441124_5_.jpg\">","external_url":"https://www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2018/05/15/a_competitive_strategy_to_counter_russian_aggression_113447.html","autor":"RealClearDefense - Homepage","published_date":"May 15, 2018 at 03:43PM","image_url":"https://assets.realclear.com/images/44/441124_5_.jpg","_id":"44PEqJyvyDlm1W3X"}

{"title":"China's Play for Military Bases in the E. Indian Ocean","content":"<img src=\"https://assets.realclear.com/images/44/449070_5_.jpg\" title=\"China’s Play for Military Bases in the Eastern Indian Ocean | RealClearDefense\"><br><div><div class=\"article-body-text\"><p class=\"clear\"/><p>China is moving to establish a network of naval and air bases in the Indian Ocean to support its growing strategic imperatives in the region. This likely includes plans to build bases in the eastern Indian Ocean, in waters much closer to Australia. Australia cannot afford to play onlooker to these developments.</p>\n<p>In July 2017, China opened its first overseas military base in <a href=\"https://www.policyforum.net/chinas-indian-ocean-power-play/\" target=\"_blank\">Djibouti</a>, and Beijing is currently in negotiations with Pakistan to establish an additional base at or near Gwadar on the Arabian Sea. </p>\n<p>But it will not be enough for China to only have capabilities in the north-west Indian Ocean, far from Australia. China’s strategic imperatives, and the Indian Ocean’s distance from Chinese territory, mean that Beijing will likely see a need to develop a network of military facilities of various types across the ocean, including in its central/eastern zone.</p>\n<p>These bases will be required if China wants to be able to protect the entire length of its east–west sea lines across the Indian Ocean. Just as importantly, Beijing has growing political imperatives to protect the large number of Chinese nationals and assets across the region. </p>\n<p>Chinese naval presence in the Indian Ocean is forecast to grow from the current 4–5 vessels to around 20 or more surface vessels and submarines in coming years. This will require a network of naval logistics facilities, including submarine support facilities, particularly if China is to pursue a serious sea denial or sea control strategy across the northern Indian Ocean. </p>\n<p>It is not only about naval bases. China will also require air bases in at least three quadrants of the Indian Ocean (north-west, north-east, and south-west) to provide adequate air cover for its Indian Ocean fleet. The People’s Liberation Army Air Force will not be able to provide adequate coverage with long-range maritime surveillance aircraft (let alone short-range strike aircraft), based in southern/western China. The deployment of aircraft carriers to the Indian Ocean or the use of air tankers based in China are unlikely to be enough to bridge the gap.</p>\n<p>China’s eastern Indian Ocean gambit has been playing out for a while, with Beijing preparing the ground in the Maldives, Sri Lanka, and/or Myanmar. This is a percentages game. China’s ability to achieve its goals is far from assured, and there will probably be pushback, to different degrees, from potential host governments as well as from others.</p>\n<p>The jostling for influence in those countries between China and India is already highly reminiscent of US–Soviet competition for influence during the Cold War, and will likely grow in the future. </p>\n<p>There has been much controversy over the port of Hambantota in Sri Lanka. This sits close to sea lanes across the northern Indian Ocean and would make a fine logistics facility. The takeover of Hambantota by a Chinese company in an equity-for-debt swap last year heightened concerns that the uneconomic port may be converted into a naval base.</p>\n<p>Sri Lanka has gone to great lengths to reassure India that Hambantota would not be used for this purpose. But Delhi remains sceptical of Sri Lanka’s claims, fearing that Chinese economic power will eventually force that country to bow to its demands.</p>\n<p>The Maldives archipelago, located in the central Indian Ocean, would also make it an ideal location. Concerns about growing Chinese influence there came to a head early this year during a “self coup” by President Abdulla Yameen, who is seen as a close friend of Beijing.</p>\n<p>But although the Maldives has long been within India’s sphere of influence, Delhi could do little about the coup. Despite conducting large military exercises nearby to show its displeasure, in fact <a href=\"https://www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2018/05/15/chinas_play_for_military_bases_in_the_eastern_indian_ocean_113449.html\">Delhi’s options were limited</a>.</p>\n<p>India had weak grounds on which to intervene under international law (something important for Delhi), and there were real concerns that Beijing might step in to protect Yameen if it did. Indeed, China publicly <a href=\"https://www.firstpost.com/world/china-hopes-its-ties-with-india-wont-be-impacted-by-maldives-crisis-warns-against-external-interference-in-island-nation-4343537.html\" target=\"_blank\">warned against any intervention by India</a>, stating that it did not want the coup to become another “flashpoint”. Concerns about a possible unintended shooting match may have been heightened by the likely presence of Chinese security personnel in the Maldives capital.</p>\n<p>India was less concerned about restoring democracy in the Maldives and more about the potential for a Chinese base there, particularly on the island of Gan at the southern end of the archipelago.</p>\n<p>This is the location of an old British naval and air base which was used up until the 1970s. Its position, relatively close to the US base on Diego Garcia, makes it well placed to cover the central Indian Ocean. For a decade the Indian navy has, with the consent of the Maldives Government, maintained a small maritime surveillance presence at Gan. </p>\n<p>But the Indian presence may now have become a bargaining point. In April, Yameen <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/stunned-by-gift-return-india-calls-males-dornier-bluff/articleshow/63672101.cms\" target=\"_blank\">ordered the withdrawal of an Indian naval helicopter from Gan</a>. There are strong suspicions this was done to make way for China.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the development of a Chinese naval and air base on Gan or elsewhere in the Maldives would be a game changer in the Indian Ocean, potentially threatening the U.S. military presence at Diego Garcia. The<span> </span><a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-dispatches-warship-to-maldives-for-joint-surveillance-of-exclusive-economic-zone/articleshow/64127734.cms\" target=\"_blank\">announcement</a> a few days ago that an Indian naval vessel would be permitted to undertake a short patrol in Maldives waters is probably part of an effort by Yameen to play Delhi and Beijing against each other.</p>\n<p>Myanmar is another good location. A Chinese naval base there would be well placed to threaten India’s naval dominance of the Bay of Bengal and protect (or threaten) the sea lanes that cross the bay and transit the Strait of Malacca. Although Myanmar’s previous military regime was a close collaborator with Beijing for almost three decades, it was able to successfully resist Chinese efforts to build a military presence in its country (despite some reports to the contrary). </p>\n<p>But Myanmar’s new government may not be able to resist Chinese approaches forever. Chinese companies have built a new port at Kyaukpyu in Rakhine State as the terminus of a road and pipeline that links China’s Yunnan province with the ocean. Last October, China acquired a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/china-silkroad-myanmar-port/china-to-take-70-percent-stake-in-strategic-port-in-myanmar-official-idUSL4N1MS3UB\" target=\"_blank\">70% stake in the port</a> and might well increase that share if Myanmar can’t come up with further funding.</p>\n<p>China’s plans for Kyaukpyu port, however, may include elements consistent only with naval requirements, not commercial use. </p>\n<p>For several decades, Australia has expended a lot of defence resources in the western side of the Indian Ocean, including on having a significant part of the Ausralian Navy chase pirates and drug smugglers. But these new challenges present more fundamental threats.</p>\n<p>It is time to pay much more attention to the strategic environment in the eastern Indian Ocean, much closer to our shores. The bad news is that this will require a much greater commitment of defence, diplomatic, and financial resources by Australia to countries in this region. </p>\n<hr/>\n<p><em><strong>Dr. David Brewster</strong> is with the National Security College at the Australian National University, where he specialises in South Asian and Indian Ocean strategic affairs.

{"title":"Using a Clausewitzian Dictum to Rethink Achieving Victory","content":"<img src=\"https://assets.realclear.com/images/44/449074_5_.png\" title=\"Using a Clausewitzian Dictum to Rethink Achieving Victory | RealClearDefense\"><br><div><div class=\"article-body-text\"><p class=\"clear\"/><p><em>“War is thus an act of force to compel the enemy to do our will.”</em><br/>—Carl von Clausewitz, <em>On War</em>, Book 1, Chapter 1.</p>\n<p>Clausewitz’s off-quoted dictum appears the master key to victory.[1] It all seems so simple: just force others to comply with what you want. The dictum is nevertheless quite wrong.</p>\n<p>Wars are fought for a reason. Clausewitz wrote, “When whole communities go to war…the reason always lies in some political situation, and the occasion is always due to some political object.”[2] For Clausewitz then the intent behind making war is to resolve a political disagreement between the communities concerned but he goes beyond that. War is also a “true political instrument.”[3] It is a way states can choose to use their military means to achieve political ends.</p>\n<p>In being so used to resolve disagreements, war is “an act of human intercourse,” albeit murderous and bloody.[4] In this clash of political interests, the entities involved continually respond to the actions of the other as they strive for some useful advantage. As the old saying goes, the enemy gets a vote; the adversary is “an animate object that<span> </span><em>reacts</em>.”[5]</p>\n<div class=\"body-photo-inline\">\n\n<p class=\"body-photo-title\"><em>Wellington and Napoleon. For each, an enemy who reacted...and thought ahead. (YouTube)</em></p>\n</div>\n<p>War accordingly involves countering intelligent and adaptive others. It entails an interdependent relationship where each party continuously modifies its position, intent, and actions based on the perceptions and actions of the others participating. Thomas Schelling observed that these interactions “...are essentially bargaining situations…in which the ability of one participant to gain his ends is dependent…on the choices or decisions the other participant will make.”[6]</p>\n<p>War is then a violent activity where we bargain with an adversary to come to a political outcome on which both agree. Until both sides concur, the war continues. We cannot compel belief in others. It is important here to note that this discussion concerns feuding groups or, as Clausewitz might say, whole communities or whole peoples.[7] While he used duelling as an analogy in discussing war, he asserted, “war is not a contest between individuals.”[8]</p>\n<p>Violence may force other groups and countries to do under duress what we want in the short term, but this doesn't bring a settled, durable peace. The remarkable military successes of Napoleon inspired Clausewitz to write<span> </span><em>On War</em>, but Napoleon’s battlefield successes proved ephemeral. Clausewitz’s Prussia was convincingly beaten in 1806 in the Jena campaign, but came back militarily in the 1813 and 1814 campaigns and again at Waterloo in 1815.</p>\n<p><strong><em>VIOLENCE MAY FORCE OTHER GROUPS AND COUNTRIES TO DO UNDER DURESS WHAT WE WANT IN THE SHORT TERM, BUT THIS DOESN'T BRING A SETTLED, DURABLE PEACE.</em></strong></p>\n<p>The Israelis are a contemporary example; they have won many seemingly decisive battles but are still searching for victory. The Palestinians may be scattered and partly live in occupied lands but Israel is unable to compel them to come to a peaceful resolution of their territorial disagreement. The two side’s political differences remain unresolved, so their political interaction—their human intercourse—continues, sometimes violently and occasionally at times through war.</p>\n<p>The aim of war as a true political instrument is therefore to purposefully advance agreement between us and our adversary on our shared future political relationship.[9] In this there are two parties involved; it is not just a unilateral imposition of will by one side. Peace is made relative to the parties involved; it is not some absolute value as Clausewitz’s dictum might suggest. Considering this, the dictum could be redrafted to: “Wars are a way to help change the political relationship between us to one we both consent to.”</p>\n<p>There are several issues with this suggestion.</p>\n<p>First, to define victory we need to specify the future political relationship we want with the adversary. This is not the job of strategy but rather of grand strategy where the future relationship, the ways possible to achieve this, and the means available are related.[10] In this, recall that grand strategy involves more than just the military means; it rather guides the coherent use of all the instruments of national power together with the development of these instruments. Such aspects are outside the scope of Clausewitz’s book, which as the title<span> </span><em>On War</em><span> </span>suggests encompasses the subfield of military strategy and tactics.</p>\n\n<p>An aside for American readers: The U.S. National Security Strategy should not be conflated with the concept of grand strategy. The National Security Strategy addresses certain matters of particular Congressional concern as required under the 1986 Goldwater-Nichols Act. Recent National Security Strategy documents have been examples of the relatively rare and problematic milieu type. This type addresses the whole international system whereas the positional type addresses one specific state or a small group of states.[11] Most grand strategies are positional with a well-known example being the U.S. grand strategy of containment during the Cold War era. This grand strategy gradually grew to involve taking actions across the globe however it was consistently focussed on addressing a single bilateral relationship of concern, that between the U.S. and the USSR. Other issues of concern to the U.S. were then addressed using methodologies and techniques appropriate to each problem.[12] States have many different problems so relying on one grand strategy even of the National Security Strategy example is demonstrably inadequate.[13] The National Security Strategy deals with certain congressionally mandated issues but is not the sum total of the grand strategy problem solving methodology.</p>\n<p>Second, in developing a grand strategy, the end sought is a better peace as Liddell-Hart observed.[14] It is not to return to the<span> </span><em>status quo ante<span> </span></em>because that set of conditions led to the war in the first place. Such a peace would be devised through both parties formally or informally agreeing to the new rules and arrangements that would underpin their future political relationship. In trying to define a better peace, the academic discipline of international relations has been examining interstate political relationships for decades. The discipline’s concepts can provide the structural framework for better peace thinking, although the content will depend on the specific context.</p>\n<p>Third, political interaction does not end when fighting ceases; changes in the relationship continue because of purposeful action or accidental events. The end of the Second World War saw an occupation that through well-considered activities gradually led to a democratic German state.[15] One grand strategy followed another that again sought a better peace. In the case of Japan, agreement was reached to end the war based on the Potsdam Declaration of 26 July 1945, which included a subtle implication the Emperor might be retained.[16] Succeeding the island-hopping Pacific grand strategy, another grand strategy then progressively came into play that with time reintegrated Japan into the liberal world order.[17]</p>\n<p>Fourth, defining the better peace sought means the term national interest can be more constrained in its use. The term has long been criticised as meaning different things to different people, having an imprecise meaning, and of being used to justify any policy the term’s user decided to support.[18]</p>\n<p>In terms of practical implementation, declarations of national interests have proven difficult to link to strategy through having no defined objective. It is then unknown when it is reached or the time it should be reached by or where it ranks in resource priority order. National interest statements are more expressions of national aspirations than purposeful policy shapers.[19] For example, the latest U.S. National Security Strategy document lists one of four vital national interests as “promote American prosperity.” It’s reasonable to assume all U.S. administrations have had such a desire, rather than the converse. With a better understanding of the better peace sought, national interest declarations can be shifted from being a primary strategy determinant to having a more secondary, rhetorical function.</p>\n<p>Fifth, agreeing a better peace might be a reasonable proposal, but some adversaries may be so far beyond the pale, bargaining with them is repugnant. The obvious candidates are terrorist groups such as the Islamic State and Al-Qaeda. The campaign against Islamic State seems to show a possible path for dealing with those with whom we will not negotiate: reducing their scale (through military or other means) and then keeping them to a level where the damage they inflict on others is kept at a broadly tolerable level. This is effectively a risk management approach, roughly similar to policing criminal activities.</p>\n<p><strong><em>AN INABILITY TO REACH AN AGREEMENT WITH AN ADVERSARY CAN MEAN A FOREVER WAR.</em></strong></p>\n<p>With such an approach there is no resolution of the conflict, merely ongoing violence into the indefinite future. Israel is trapped in such an intractable conflict with the Palestinians, popularly termed mowing the grass.[20] Low-level hostility occurs daily with periodic short, sharp wars albeit Israeli losses are kept limited. The downsides are clear though given last year was the 50th anniversary of the Israeli occupation of the Palestine West Bank. An inability to reach an agreement with an adversary can mean a forever war.</p>\n<p>Finally, as the reader may already have discerned, my implied criticism of Clausewitz is somewhat unfair. He used the dictum that “war is thus an act of force to compel the enemy to do our will” as a Hegelian device to draw attention to what happened if a concept was taken too far towards his abstract absolute war model.[21] Clausewitz knew the real world was very different and said as much in Book 1 Chapter 2 and Book 8 Chapter 6. In the later book, with a forewarning of Liddell-Hart’s better peace, he declares:</p>\n<p>“we maintain…that war is simply a continuation of political intercourse, with the addition of other means. We deliberately use the phrase “addition of other means” because we also want to make it clear that war in itself does not suspend political intercourse or change it into something entirely different. That intercourse continues, irrespective of the means it employs. The main lines along which military events progress, and to which they are restricted, are political lines that continue throughout the war into the subsequent peace.”[22]</p>\n<div class=\"body-photo-inline\">\n\n<p class=\"body-photo-title\"><em>Kruschev and Kennedy During the Cuban Missile Crisis.

War is not, in the end, about compulsion, it is all about bargaining violently.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1526089523123_35582\" class=\"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\">\n<div class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><em><strong>Peter Layton</strong> is a Visiting Fellow at the Griffith Asia Institute at Griffith University and author of<span> </span></em><a href=\"https://smile.amazon.com/Grand-Strategy-Peter-Layton/dp/0648279308/\">Grand Strategy</a>.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\">This article appeared originally at <strong><a href=\"https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2018/5/15/using-a-clausewitzian-dictum-to-rethink-achieving-victory\">Strategy Bridge</a></strong>.</p>\n<div id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1526375771138_147\" class=\"entry-content e-content\">\n<div id=\"item-5af6477170a6adc5dcf2872b\" class=\"sqs-layout sqs-grid-12 columns-12\" data-layout-label=\"Post Body\" data-type=\"item\" data-updated-on=\"1526094073056\">\n<div id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1526375771138_146\" class=\"row sqs-row\">\n<div id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1526375771138_145\" class=\"col sqs-col-12 span-12\">\n<div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1526089523123_33876\" class=\"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\">\n<div class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n<h3>NOTES:</h3>\n<p>[1] Victory may be examined at different levels.

It’s certainly one of my favourite features of the iPhone X, especially when logging into apps, where the login experience is almost invisible.

Resources will be distributed throughout the community in the form of grants and investments, and Adobe encourages customers, developers, and entrepreneurs to apply today.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/fund1.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all&amp;strip=all\"><img data-attachment-id=\"533191\" data-permalink=\"https://9to5mac.com/2018/05/15/adobe-free-xd-starter-plan-design-fund/fund/\" data-orig-file=\"https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/fund1.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all\" data-orig-size=\"3816,1536\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1526315002&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Fund\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/fund1.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all&amp;w=655\" data-large-file=\"https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/fund1.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1000\" title=\"Adobe redoubles UX design focus with free XD Starter Plan, new Design Fund, more\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-533191 size-full\" src=\"https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/fund1.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"\"/></a></p>\n<p>As competition in the space of creative applications becomes increasingly crowded, Adobe’s scale enables it to serve the market in a way other companies simply can’t. While the company has plans to expand the fund’s scope in the future, it launches today with an initial focus on a relatively new tool, <a href=\"https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html\">Adobe XD</a>. The decision to pour resources into user experience design was informed, in part, by a <a href=\"https://theblog.adobe.com/hiring-trends-in-ux-design-the-6-things-you-need-to-know-about-techs-fastest-growing-field/\">survey</a> of 251 hiring managers conducted by Adobe last year. Vinh noted “The survey found that nearly 9 in 10 said that adding more UX design expertise to their organization was a top priority.”</p>\n<p>It is perhaps then of little surprise to learn that Adobe has also <a href=\"https://theblog.adobe.com/may-2018-update-adobe-xd/\">announced</a> several new features and enhancements for Adobe XD CC, and given us a little sneak peek into the future of the software. “Prior to officially releasing XD, we incubated the tool for nearly two years in the design community,” said Guzman.</p>\n<p>Adobe XD was <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2015/10/05/adobe-photoshop-fix-capture-cc-mix-lightroom-mobile-creative-cloud-sync/\">first previewed</a> in October 2015 and initially called Project Comet. A series of <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2016/03/14/adobe-experience-design-preview-project-comet-ux/\">public previews</a> throughout 2016 and 2017 helped Adobe gather user feedback before <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2017/10/18/adobe-max-2017-creative-cloud-lightroom-cc-sensei/\">formally releasing</a> XD at last fall’s Adobe MAX conference. In the months that followed, regular updates have added features like <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2017/11/14/adobe-xd-design-specs-layout-grid/\">Design Specs</a> and <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2018/01/23/adobe-photoshop-select-subject-xd-integrations/\">third-party integrations</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/timeline1.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all&amp;strip=all\"><img data-attachment-id=\"533186\" data-permalink=\"https://9to5mac.com/2018/05/15/adobe-free-xd-starter-plan-design-fund/timeline-8/\" data-orig-file=\"https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/timeline1.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all\" data-orig-size=\"2880,1281\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Timeline\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/timeline1.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all&amp;w=655\" data-large-file=\"https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/timeline1.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1000\" title=\"Adobe redoubles UX design focus with free XD Starter Plan, new Design Fund, more\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-533186\" src=\"https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/timeline1.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/timeline1.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all 1000w, https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/timeline1.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all 2000w, https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/timeline1.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all 155w, https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/timeline1.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all 655w, https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/timeline1.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all 768w, https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/timeline1.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"/></a></p>\n<p>For the remainder of 2018, Adobe has chosen three areas of focus surrounding XD: extensibility, building more advanced animation and prototyping features, and collaboration and asset management. New for May are several features designed to address productivity. Adobe has outlined some of the more notable changes in detail:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Swap Symbols</strong>: You can now swap symbols on the design canvas by dragging a symbol from the assets panel and dropping it directly onto the symbol you want to replace. From there, all copies of the symbol on the canvas will automatically be replaced.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Paste to Multiple Artboards</strong>: Simply copy any object to the clipboard, select one or more target artboards and paste. Your content will be placed in the same X and Y location on the target locations. If the target artboard is smaller than the source artboard the content will be centered.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Password Protected Design Specs</strong>: Further adding support for password protection on prototypes in our last release, we’ve extended this to published Design Specs (Beta), so now you can share both prototypes and design specs with a password being required to view them by stakeholders.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/artboards.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all&amp;strip=all\"><img data-attachment-id=\"533188\" data-permalink=\"https://9to5mac.com/2018/05/15/adobe-free-xd-starter-plan-design-fund/artboards/\" data-orig-file=\"https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/artboards.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all\" data-orig-size=\"2868,1794\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Artboards\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/artboards.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all&amp;w=655\" data-large-file=\"https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/artboards.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1000\" title=\"Adobe redoubles UX design focus with free XD Starter Plan, new Design Fund, more\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-533188\" src=\"https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/artboards.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/artboards.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all 1000w, https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/artboards.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all 2000w, https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/artboards.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all 155w, https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/artboards.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all 655w, https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/artboards.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all 768w, https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/artboards.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"/></a></p>\n<p>Alongside these features, integrations with Photoshop and Sketch have seen significant performance improvements and fixes, and file auto-recovery has been added. Adobe is also working on several highly requested additions for XD that are still in preliminary stages of development. In an early preview, Guzman shared that Adobe has focused on advanced prototyping, testing tools that will allow designers to add overlays, fixed elements, and timed transitions to their previews. Adobe is even experimenting with an advanced Auto Animate feature, bringing keyframe-style position interpolation to layers. “One of the things that we know about designers is that if you give them a small feature, they’ll do amazing things with it,” Guzman added.</p>\n<p>For many, the most significant addition in May’s update will be a new, <a href=\"https://theblog.adobe.com/advancing-experience-design-adobe-xd\">free Starter Plan</a> that makes available XD’s core features to everyone on both macOS and Windows. Free users will receive a small amount of cloud storage and be limited to sharing one prototype and one design spec at a time, with an upgrade option available.</p>\n<p>By building a free tier, Adobe has created an opportunity to present customers of all skills levels with a platform that provides reputable educational resources about UX best practices and correct human interface guidelines. When asked about Adobe’s role in design education, Vihn commented, “The effort to promote XD is not just about getting the tool in front of everybody, but also thinking about what it takes for designers to be successful in general. Education is a big part of that.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/font-pack.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all&amp;strip=all\"><img data-attachment-id=\"533185\" data-permalink=\"https://9to5mac.com/2018/05/15/adobe-free-xd-starter-plan-design-fund/font-pack/\" data-orig-file=\"https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/font-pack.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all\" data-orig-size=\"2000,875\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Font Pack\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/font-pack.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all&amp;w=655\" data-large-file=\"https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/font-pack.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1000\" title=\"Adobe redoubles UX design focus with free XD Starter Plan, new Design Fund, more\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-533185\" src=\"https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/font-pack.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/font-pack.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all 1000w, https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/font-pack.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all 155w, https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/font-pack.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all 655w, https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/font-pack.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all 768w, https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/font-pack.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all 1024w, https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/font-pack.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"/></a></p>\n<p><em>One of Adobe’s new Font Packs.</em></p>\n<p>Vinh points to the Adobe <a href=\"https://theblog.adobe.com/comprehensive-guide-ux-design/\">blog</a> and <a href=\"https://helpx.adobe.com/xd/tutorials.html\">tutorial websites</a> for <a href=\"https://theblog.adobe.com/what-is-ux-and-why-should-you-care/\">examples</a> of the company’s dedication to education, specifically in <a href=\"https://theblog.adobe.com/web-developer-ux-designer-15-practical-tips-make-career-transition-happen/\">UX design</a>.

With a big smile and full of charm, he suggested that we postpone it. We declined, but he kept pressing. Eventually my wife countered with a suggestion that if he really wanted “her” John so much, he should loan John Lassiter to her media company for a day of consulting. Steve went from full charm to ice cold really damn quick. I didn’t do that keynote.</p></blockquote>\n<p>He was also one of the few people in the world to decline a phone call from Steve – albeit accidentally.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I was debriefing the team after the Rage launch when I got a call. I was busy, so I declined it. A few minutes later someone came in and said that Steve was going to call me. Oops.</p>\n<p>Everyone had a chuckle about me “hanging up on Steve Jobs”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Carmack says that his appreciation for Apple started young. Wanting an Apple 2 computer was a ‘defining characteristic’ of his childhood, and his first major purchase as an adult was a NeXT workstation – using that to develop Doom.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We loved our NeXTs, and we wanted to launch Doom with an explicit “Developed on NeXT computers” logo during the startup process, but when we asked, the request was denied.</p>\n<p>Some time after launch, when Doom had begun to make its cultural mark, we heard that Steve had changed his mind and would be happy to have NeXT branding on it, but that ship had sailed.</p></blockquote>\n<p>He says that one frustrating aspect of working with Steve was the Apple co-founder’s refusal to admit when he was wrong.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It was often frustrating, because he could talk, with complete confidence, about things he was just plain wrong about, like the price of memory for video cards and the amount of system bandwidth exploitable by the AltiVec extensions.</p></blockquote>\n<p>But the best aspect was Steve’s decisiveness.</p>\n<blockquote><p>When Steve did make up his mind, he was decisive about it.

In <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2018/05/15/apple-samsung-lawsuit-greg-joswiak/\">addition to the comments made</a> by Apple’s VP of product marketing Greg Joswiak, today’s opening statements brought a few notable tidbits about the iPhone creation process and more…</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-533415\"/>\n\t<ins class=\"adsbygoogle author_ad\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-4344806526196296\" data-ad-slot=\"3606871832\"/>\n\n\t\t\n</p><div class=\"th5b55aab9 th9c1babf7\"><div class=\"th9ac4e47e\"><div class=\"th961f4cac th076d0b06\"><div class=\"th9ac4e47e\" data-thdf7f2d66=\"https://goo.gl/Z1kKAF\"><img src=\"https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/sylvania-homekit-strips.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all&amp;resize=300%2C250\"/><h3>Sylvania HomeKit Light Strip</h3></div></div></div></div>\n<p>Richard Howarth, senior director of Apple’s design team and one of the lead iPhone designers, kicked things off today with a pretty blanket statement, as noted by <em><a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/eight-years-on-apple-employees-still-sore-about-samsung-copying/\">CNET</a></em>. Howarth argued that Samsung “blatantly ripped off” the iPhone’s design.  “They were trying to rip off part of the iconic nature and say, ‘We’re cool, too,'” he said.</p>\n<p>Howarth continued and explained that Apple rejected “hundreds and hundreds” of iPhone prototypes during the initial design process – included rounded models, one with an octagonal bezel, and more:</p>\n<blockquote><p>One had an octagonal bezel, one was rounded only on the left and right edges, and one had a light-gray front. “It didn’t represent what we were trying to do, which was create something that felt friendly and understandable,” Howarth said. “It looked pretty big and square from the front. It felt bitty — just lots of bits.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>The ultimate design is one that felt like “something you could get your head around,” Howarth concluded.</p>\n<p>This, Howarth argues, is what makes Apple’s design patents so valuable. “The phone is an idea. The whole thing is the phone..You can’t take just a part and say ‘Let’s protect just that’,” he said.</p>\n<p>During cross-examination by Samsung’s lawyer, Joswiak admitted that Apple does study competitors’ phones, but never copies what they do:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“We do tear them apart to see what’s on the inside, but we don’t copy what they do. That’s the difference between doing what’s right and wrong.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Meanwhile, Tony Blevins, VP of procurement at Apple, gave an emotional recount of that initial design process, and when Samsung unveiled its copycat devices, it hit the Apple team hard:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“A small group of us had worked tirelessly on this product for years. We worked late nights and weekends, we sacrificed family time, we missed birthdays. We filed for patents and tried to do things in the right way so we could enjoy the fruits of our labor,” he said. When the Samsung phones arrived, “It was every negative emotion you could imagine.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Blevins also recounted Apple’s design philosophy, explaining that many companies use a “building-block philosophy,” which is the “exact opposite” of Apple. He remarked that he spent two and a half weeks in a factory just trying to make the vibration motor small enough to fit.</p>\n<p><strong>More on Apple v Samsung in 2018: </strong></p>\n\n<hr/>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/9to5mac?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:</a></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UN9ALKDu80s?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\">VIDEO</iframe></span></p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t</div><img style=\"height : 1px; width : 1px;\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/reuters.jpg\">","external_url":"https://9to5mac.com/2018/05/15/apple-samsung-opening-statements/","autor":"9to5Mac","published_date":"May 16, 2018 at 04:41AM","image_url":"https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/reuters.jpg","_id":"N3Dnx91cPMH2O3lX"}

This lets any Twitter user access a text description of the image (like with VoiceOver) when a text description of the image is supplied.</p>\n<p>Other media changes include the ability to auto-play videos from the timeline view without clicking (by using a mouse over) which can be toggled on and off, and swipeable image windows when clicking grouped images from tweets.</p>\n<p>Tweetbot 3 also has visual tweaks and refinements throughout — and dark mode is perhaps the most dramatic. Tweetbot has long had a gray themed option on iOS, and today Tweetbot 3 for Mac introduces dark mode for macOS. Tweetbot still includes the default light view (which I still prefer when running Tweetbot alongside Safari) but the dark theme is now an appearance option too.</p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"533321\" data-permalink=\"https://9to5mac.com/2018/05/15/tweetbot-3-for-mac-dark-mode/tweetbot-3-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/tweetbot-31.png?w=1000&amp;h=625\" data-orig-size=\"2880,1800\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Tweetbot 3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/tweetbot-31.png?w=1000&amp;h=625?w=655\" data-large-file=\"https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/tweetbot-31.png?w=1000&amp;h=625?w=1000\" title=\"Tweetbot 3 for Mac debuting today with dark mode, expanded side bar, and more\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-533321\" src=\"https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/tweetbot-31.png?w=1000&amp;h=625\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/tweetbot-31.png?w=1000&amp;h=625 1000w, https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/tweetbot-31.png?w=2000&amp;h=1250 2000w, https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/tweetbot-31.png?w=155&amp;h=97 155w, https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/tweetbot-31.png?w=655&amp;h=409 655w, https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/tweetbot-31.png?w=768&amp;h=480 768w, https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/tweetbot-31.png?w=1024&amp;h=640 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"/></p>\n<p>Tweetbot 3 is launching on the Mac just a few weeks after Twitter <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2018/02/16/rip-twitter-for-mac/\">officially killed off</a> its own client for macOS, and before a<a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2018/04/06/twitter-api-breaking-tweetbot-twitterrific-features/\"> now-delayed API change</a> that will affect remaining third-party apps.

For every service member, the answer will be different. Some professional soldiers may face a true combat situation a few times in a twenty-year career. Others may go from the recruiter's office to combat in a matter of months and return many, many times. One commonality between these two extremes is that in each, a service member has a first experience; a moment that will likely change them forever. This article describes results of a survey that sought to capture veteran perceptions of first combat experiences to inform future generations as to what they might expect under similar circumstances.</p><span class=\"more-link\"><a href=\"https://mwi.usma.edu/baptism-fire-survey-first-combat-experiences/\">Read Full Article »</a></span><p class=\"clear\"/></div></div><img style=\"height : 1px; width : 1px;\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"https://assets.realclear.com/images/44/441038_1_.jpg\">","external_url":"https://www.realcleardefense.com/2018/05/15/baptism_by_fire_a_survey_of_first_combat_experiences_302040.html","autor":"RealClearDefense - Homepage","published_date":"May 15, 2018 at 03:43PM","image_url":"https://assets.realclear.com/images/44/441038_1_.jpg","_id":"OPS9IlNCwUltoUCn"}

Cloud DVR allows users to record up to 20 hours of content for no additional charge. Recorded content remains available for 30 days after the initial airing.</p>\n<p>DirecTV says, however, that it will launch a new tier with 100 hours of recording and 90 days of storage for an extra $10 per month. That will tack $10/month on to your bill, though.</p>\n<p>Notably, Cloud DVR does support rewinding and fast-forwarding, meaning you’ll be able to skip commercials with ease:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Twenty hours of free recording is currently available today as we continue to evolve our beta testing of the Cloud DVR feature and expand availability to all DIRECTV NOW customers.</p>\n<p>Record your favorites and watch virtually anytime you want for up to 30 days on your compatible smartphone, tablet or connected big screen at home. Record an entire series or just one episode on almost all our channels. Fast forward and rewind at will.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In addition to Cloud DVR, DirecTV Now is also expanding its on-demand library. While the service initially touted more than 25,000 titles, it’s now adding “even more on-demand entertainment,” with new episodes of select shows being available on-demand after airing. While you can’t fast-forward through commercials in on-demand content, it will help you preserve some of your needed Cloud DVR capacity.</p>\n<p>You can also now watch up to three streams at once on DirecTV Now. While the service has long-supported two streams, you can add a third stream for $5 per month:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Enjoy access to up to three simultaneous different streams per account. Don’t want to watch cartoons with the kids? Sick of your spouse’s love for reality TV? Don’t worry – we’ve got you covered beyond the standard two streams with a third stream for $5 per month.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Last but certainly not least, AT&amp;T has revamped the DirecTV Now interface on iOS and tvOS.

This means that once you download the app and sign-in with your Google account, Google News will already be populated with stories and headlines it thinks you will care about.</p>\n<p>In the app, the “For You” tab houses a rundown of stories that Google thinks you’ll be interested in. For me, this ranged from some political news to technology and sports.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the “Headlines” feature serves as way to quickly skim through the biggest news of the day. You can sort by the latest stories, as well as topics such as business, technology, sports, science, entertainment, and health.</p>\n<p>In the “Favorites” tab you can add specific topics, sources, and locations that you’re interested in. This, in turn, will show you the top content from the criteria you select.</p>\n<p>Finally, the Newsstand tab lets you see a magazine-like interface for specific publications, such as CNN, Fox News, The New York Times, Reuters, and more.</p>\n<p>Here’s how Google describes the new application:</p>\n<blockquote><p>With Google News, you’ll see:</p>\n<p>Your briefing – It can be nearly impossible to keep up with every story you care about. With your briefing, easily stay in the know about what’s important and relevant to you. Your briefing updates throughout the day bringing you the top five stories you need to know, including local, national, and world content.</p>\n<p>Full coverage – Understand the full context on any story with just a tap. Google News gives you everything online about a story and organizes it for you – highlighting different perspectives, a timeline of key events, FAQs, important people, and more.</p>\n<p>Credible sources – Find quality content from a diverse set of credible publishers and discover sources you haven’t heard of before.</p>\n<p>Stories, for you – Keep up with what’s happening on the topics you care about, whether that’s travel, politics, sports, tech, or fashion.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Google News for iOS comes at a time when Apple is putting an increasingly heavy focus on its own Apple News app. The company <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2018/04/30/apple-news-exclusive-feature/\">recently published its first “Apple News Exclusive” piece</a>, while its <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2018/05/07/apple-hiring-editorial-content/\">hiring trends suggest that</a> the focus on editorial is only just beginning.</p>\n<p>The Google News app is available for both iPhone and iPad on the App Store.

{"title":"North Korea and 'The Libyan Model'","content":"<img src=\"https://assets.realclear.com/images/44/449077_5_.jpg\" title=\"North Korea and ‘The Libyan Model’ | RealClearDefense\"><br><div><div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p>With the location and date of the forthcoming summit between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong‑un now fixed, speculation has turned to what sort of agreement might be achievable. US National Security Advisor John Bolton<span> </span><a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-national-security-adviser-john-bolton-on-face-the-nation-april-29-2018/\" target=\"_blank\">recently suggested</a><span> </span>that the ‘Libyan model’ of nuclear disarmament—from 2003–2004—might offer a framework that could be applied to North Korea in 2018.</p>\n<p>The suggestion received what might kindly be called a mixed reception, not least because the North Koreans<span> </span><a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/libyan-model-north-korean-denuclearization\" target=\"_blank\">believe</a><span> </span>that Muammar al-Qaddafi was a fool to abandon his nuclear program. Still, I’d like to explore the Libyan case here because it offers one of the few examples of ‘denuclearisation’ that we have.</p>\n<p>True, the two cases are markedly dissimilar: Libya, unlike North Korea, had made relatively little progress towards nuclear weapons when its leadership took the strategic decision to abandon the program. The Libyans had no nuclear weapons. Yes, they had a small number of centrifuges—some still in their original packing—and a quantity of uranium hexafluoride (the feedstock for a centrifuge enrichment cascade).</p>\n<p>More ominously, they had a nuclear weapon design, apparently obtained from the A.Q. Khan network—although some Libyans claimed that the design was a ‘bonus’ intended as a reward for their other purchases.</p>\n<p>But when US officials appeared before the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee in early 2004 to<span> </span><a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?180721-1/us-libya-relations\" target=\"_blank\">talk about the disarmament effort</a>, senators were at least as interested in the detailed picture of the nuclear black market that the Libyan program revealed as they were in the program itself. While a raft of fascinating material about the program had suddenly spilled forth, it was the procurement trail, stretching from Libya to Pakistan and Malaysia, that the committee chairman, Senator Richard Lugar, referred to as ‘the treasure trove’.</p>\n<p>While North Korea’s current indigenous capabilities are far stronger than Libya’s were 15 years ago, one suspects there would be similar interest in Washington today about Pyongyang’s proliferation links.</p>\n<p>Further, there are some aspects of the Libyan model that the current US administration might want to replicate in any deal with North Korea. Two of those aspects concern access and relocation. US and British experts were given extraordinary access to the Libyan weapons of mass destruction (WMD) program. See the statements made in 2004 by Paula DeSutter, the US Assistant Secretary of State for Verification and Compliance, to two congressional committees (<a href=\"https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/congress/2004_h/DeSutterTestimony040226.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here</a><span> </span>and<span> </span><a href=\"https://www.state.gov/s/l/2004/78305.htm\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>) and, separately, in an<span> </span><a href=\"https://www.armscontrol.org/aca/DeSutterInterview\" target=\"_blank\">interview</a><span> </span>with<span> </span><em>Arms Control Today</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Libyans said, ‘We are no longer going to have a nuclear weapons program.’ They invited the United States and the United Kingdom in. They gave the United States and the United Kingdom access to all facilities that we requested to see. They were willing to permit any tests that we wanted to conduct. They were willing to have their centrifuge program removed … They have been very forthcoming.</p>\n<p>In the chemical weapons area, we assisted them in drafting their declaration to the OPCW [Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons]. They had the OPCW technical secretariat come in. On one occasion they said, ‘You know, we really hadn’t told the others that came before, but there are some other munitions we need to show you.’ They took us to a facility that we almost certainly would not have been able to identify independently and showed us the unfilled munitions there. That is transparency. That is the kind of access that we are given when a country has made a strategic commitment. They volunteer information.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some sources suggest that the procedure was not quite as straightforward as that passage of text implies. William Tobey, for example, argues that Libyan commitment and transparency varied on a day-to-day basis, at least in the early months. (See Tobey’s five-part series in the<span> </span><em>Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists</em>,<span> </span><a href=\"https://thebulletin.org/message-tripoli-how-libya-gave-its-wmd7834\" target=\"_blank\">Part 1</a>,<span> </span><a href=\"https://thebulletin.org/message-tripoli-part-2-how-libya-gave-its-wmd7839\" target=\"_blank\">Part 2</a>,<span> </span><a href=\"https://thebulletin.org/message-tripoli-part-3-how-libya-gave-its-wmd7843\" target=\"_blank\">Part 3</a>,<span> </span><a href=\"https://thebulletin.org/message-tripoli-part-4-how-libya-gave-its-wmd7846\" target=\"_blank\">Part 4</a><span> </span>and<span> </span><a href=\"https://thebulletin.org/message-tripoli-part-5-how-libya-gave-its-wmd7848\" target=\"_blank\">Part 5</a>, and his 2017 <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol-61-no-4/pdfs/libya-nuclear-deal.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">assessment</a><span> </span>of intelligence and policy cooperation in the Libyan disarmament case.)</p>\n<p>It was because of that variability that the Americans wanted to relocate key parts of the WMD program quickly. The most proliferation-sensitive parts of the program—equipment and documents—were airlifted to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee. The nuclear weapon design documents, revealed to the Americans on 20 January, were flown out of the country two days later.</p>\n<p>During the night of 25–26 January 2004, an American C-17, its insignia painted over, landed at an air base near Tripoli, loaded its cargo—including advanced centrifuge rotors, five Scud‑C missile guidance sets and two tons of uranium hexafluoride—and took off again. Later, in March 2004, another 1,000 tons of materials and equipment were loaded aboard a US ship, the<span> </span><em>Industrial Challenger</em>, its insignia again painted over, and taken to America.</p>\n<p>Is that what President Trump is going to propose to Kim Jong‑un?<span> </span><a href=\"http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201805100048.html\" target=\"_blank\">Media sources</a><span> </span>say that the US has asked North Korea to ‘discard’ the data from its nuclear weapon development program and allow its nuclear scientists to emigrate. Of course, the manner—and direction—in which that data might be discarded is a non-trivial issue.</p>\n<p>And emigration would, of course, be a humane solution to an intractable problem: that even after the weapons are gone and the data has been discarded, the knowledge of how to make nuclear weapons and their delivery vehicles will still exist in the minds of North Korea’s scientists. I don’t imagine, though, that Washington wants those scientists heading to the Middle East. Russia and China might be acceptable destinations. People say that Tennessee is nice this time of year.</p>\n<p>As was the case with the Libyan deal, the US is also arguing that this is an opportunity for North Korea to abandon not merely its nuclear program, but all of its WMD. Still, nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles seem likely to be the core of any deal.</p>\n<p>On ballistic missiles, a key US objective in 2003–2004 was to ensure that Libya’s missile program was compliant with the thresholds set out in the Missile Technology Control Regime—namely, that its missiles were limited in their range to a maximum of 300 kilometres and in their payload to a maximum of 500 kilograms.</p>\n<p>In short, the Libyan model sets high standards in relation to the exposure of proliferation linkages; provision of access to sites, personnel and materials; relocation of key items; and acceptance of international standards on WMD. Can an agreement with Pyongyang meet those standards? Frankly, it seems unlikely.</p>\n<p>The Libyan model, after all, had one driver that might not be equally compelling in the North Korean case: the strategic commitment by the leadership to put aside WMD. Because of that commitment, the model unfolded quickly and the verification hurdles proved surmountable.</p>\n<p>A similar level of strategic commitment on Kim Jong‑un’s part is what the Americans are hoping to find in Singapore on 12 June. The Trump administration is certainly<span> </span><a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/05/14/us-pressures-north-korea-ship-nuclear-weapons-overseas-sanctions/\" target=\"_blank\">signalling</a>that this is their desired approach.</p>\n</div>\n</div><img style=\"height : 1px; width : 1px;\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"https://assets.realclear.com/images/44/449077_5_.jpg\">","external_url":"https://www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2018/05/15/north_korea_and_the_libyan_model_113451.html","autor":"RealClearDefense - Homepage","published_date":"May 15, 2018 at 03:43PM","image_url":"https://assets.realclear.com/images/44/449077_5_.jpg","_id":"fvsRU2H7IhWItX82"}

The al Qaeda emir noted at the outset of his speech that there has been a “big uproar” over the Trump administration’s decision to move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. President Trump has been “clear and frank,” revealing “the true face of the modern Crusade, which does not deal with retreat and reconciliation,” according to Zawahiri.</p>\n<p>However, Zawahiri quickly pivots away from the controversy over the embassy relocation, reiterating al Qaeda’s longstanding conspiracy theory: The entire international system is hostile to Muslims. Just being part of the United Nations makes one complicit in this alleged scheme, according to bin Laden’s successor.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the title of Zawahiri’s speech, “Tel Aviv Is Also the Land of Muslims,” underscores his point. The embassy relocation is a small issue relative to the vast “Zionist-Crusader” conspiracy al Qaeda claims to oppose.</p>\n<p>Zawahiri reminds his “Muslim and mujahidin brothers and the sincere scholars” that “all of the countries of the Islamic world which are members in the United Nations have recognized Israel by signing the United Nations Charter, which confirms the unity and territorial integrity of each of its states, including Israel.” From al Qaeda’s perspective, this is the original sin found in any nation’s decision to embrace the United Nations.</p>\n<p>The al Qaeda leader claims that, by signing the UN charter, nations have agreed to leave “ruling by Sharia.” That is, they have agreed that they will not abide by the draconian laws Zawahiri and his ilk prefer. Instead, these nations are “satisfied” with governing and “ruling” according to the “decisions of the [UN] Security Council and the General Assembly,” including the decision in 1947 to partition the land.</p>\n<p>Tel Aviv and Jerusalem are both “Islamic land,” in Zawahiri’s telling. True believers need “to liberate Palestine” and “all the other abodes of Muslims” after declaring the entire “criminal international tyrannical system” to be illegitimate. Zawahiri again calls for Muslim unity, a frequent al Qaeda motif, such that the ummah (worldwide community of Muslims) engages in “battle…on multiple fronts, not as separate groups that retreat before the imperatives of the greatest criminals.”</p>\n<p>Zawahiri reminds listeners that Osama bin Laden identified America as the leader of this supposedly corrupt international system and, therefore, as the “first enemy of the Muslims.” Bin Laden first declared that Americans “would not dream of security until we actually live it in Palestine, and until all the disbelieving armies depart from the land of Muhammad.”</p>\n<p>The goal is establish “the caliphate,” Zawahiri says, after uniting “around the word of tawhid.” This will require both<span> </span><em>dawa</em><span> </span>(proselytization) and<span> </span><em>jihad</em>. And Muslims must not confuse their enemies for their friends, fighting “the battle of consciousness before the battle of weapons,” remaining “free of illusions.”</p>\n<p>In the past, al Qaeda leaders have called on Muslims to use Syrian soil to “liberate” Jerusalem. The group uses this theme as a rallying cry for jihadists in Syria.</p>\n<p>Zawahiri’s message is the 9th episode in his “Brief Messages To A Victorious Ummah” series, during which he has c<a href=\"https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2016/08/zawahiri-says-jihadists-should-prepare-for-guerrilla-war-in-iraq.php\">overed a variety of topics</a>. Although Zawahiri can be long-winded, the lectures in this program are mercifully short.</p>\n<p>Although the lecture series has been<span> </span><a href=\"https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2016/08/zawahiri-says-jihadists-should-prepare-for-guerrilla-war-in-iraq.php\">running since Aug. 2016</a>, Zawahiri and his propagandists in As Sahab clearly timed the release of this episode to coincide with the US embassy relocation to Jerusalem. It demonstrates that, at times, al Qaeda is still able to time its media to current events. Zawahiri also remains a somewhat prolific commentator, regularly releasing messages from his hideout.</p>\n<p>An<span> </span><a href=\"https://www.longwarjournal.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/18-05-13-Ayman-al-Zawahiri-9th-episode-of-Brief-Messages-To-A-Victorious-Ummah-Tel-Aviv-Is-Also-the-Land-of-Muslims-Al-Tamkin-translation.pdf\">English translation of the message</a><span> </span>was distributed via Telegram by Al-Tamkin Media, a propaganda outfit that regularly translates messages from al Qaeda’s senior leadership.

These statements should have received praise from Americans on both sides of the political aisle. Now, however, I’m not so certain that Trump is following through on his promises to avoid the next “dumb” war. </p>\n<p>This week, the president <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-scuttles-iran-nuclear-deal-but-offers-no-plan-for-what-comes-next/2018/05/08/211a91c0-52e5-11e8-abd8-265bd07a9859_story.html?utm_term=.53b06c4b02c3\">announced</a> his intention to pull out of the Iran Deal, or the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The deal was, no doubt, flawed, but it did provide an inspections regime to limit and delay any Iranian attempts to go nuclear. Perhaps, being a creation of the Obama administration, the JCPOA was doomed from the start.</p>\n<p>Iran is a mid-level menace. It aggressively pursues its interests through various proxy forces in the Mid-East—a sign of its weakness as much as power. The Islamic Republic has a burgeoning ballistic missile program (not covered by the JCPOA) and sometimes threatens Israel. This is all cause for concern and requires the U.S. military to balance and, perhaps, contain Iran. However, the Islamic Republic is decidedly <em>not</em> an existential threat to the United States. A more realist foreign policy must take this into account and avoid disastrous war.</p>\n<p>Iran is nowhere near able to launch a (non-existent) nuclear weapon at Tel Aviv, let alone New York. Furthermore, as I have previously <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2018/03/why-the-u-s-military-should-stay-out-of-iran/\">noted</a>, Iran <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/tag/iran/\">spends </a>about as much on defense annually as the U.S. does on a single aircraft carrier. Iran’s <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ir.html\">GDP</a> is about $427 billion, and it spent <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ir.html\">some</a> $11.5 billion on defense in 2016. U.S. allies, like Saudi Arabia and Israel, spend $66.7 billion, and $19.6 billion, respectively. Standing behind them is the U.S., which plans to spend $716 billion on defense in 2019, or $300 billion more than Iran’s entire GDP.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the U.S. military faces two significant problems: Iran presents a formidable obstacle to invasion, and American forces are already <a href=\"http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/were-killing-these-kids-were-breaking-the-army/\">desperately overstretched</a>. </p>\n<p>Remember back when Americans were assured that the invasion of Iraq would be a “<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/2002/02/13/cakewalk-in-iraq/cf09301c-c6c4-4f2e-8268-7c93017f5e93/?utm_term=.b1d7b3ef2830\">cakewalk</a><span>?</span>” We all know how that turned out. Iran is larger, more populous, and more mountainous than Iraq. It also has a fiercely nationalistic population, which, not-so-long-ago used human wave attacks to clear Iraqi minefields. Any U.S. invasion of Iran will require more troops and more years of patience than Washington or the populace have on hand.</p>\n<p>America’s formidable military is already spread thin, deployed in nearly <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/nick-turse/us-special-operations-forces-deploy_b_13978052.html\">70 percent</a> of the world’s countries. Our ground and air forces actively engage in combat in Niger, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. The U.S. Army is also busy sending brigades to deter Russia in Eastern Europe and to shore up defenses in South Korea. Meanwhile, the Navy is patrolling the South China Sea, and ensuring access to the Persian Gulf and Red Sea. Bottom line: America’s warriors are quite busy.</p>\n<p>The last thing Washington should do is take its eye off the ball in some <em>seven</em> ongoing shooting wars to start a new conflict with Iran. ISIS is <a href=\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-wants-apos-apos-syria-212400816.html?guccounter=1\">not yet defeated</a>, Iraq is far from politically <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/30/world/middleeast/iraq-election-abadi.html\">stable</a>, and—despite <a href=\"https://www.militarytimes.com/flashpoints/2018/03/24/gen-joseph-dunford-there-are-signs-of-progress-in-afghan-war/\">optimistic pleas</a> to the contrary— the war in Afghanistan is <a href=\"http://foreignpolicy.com/2018/05/01/the-afghan-war-isnt-being-won-says-new-pentagon-audit/\">failing</a>. The best bet is for the U.S. military to cut its losses, avoid more counterproductive interventions, and cautiously disengage from the region. </p>\n<p>The last thing American servicemen and women need is to fight a new, exhaustive war in Iran, with existing enemies to their rear. That would defy just about every sound military maxim on the books. Worse still, if we think Iran’s proxy forces are a problem now, imagine what will happen in the case of war, when Tehran would undoubtedly unleash them against U.S. bases and supply lines across the region.</p>\n<p>Personally, this combat veteran trusts President Trump’s <a href=\"http://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/384234-trump-should-follow-his-instincts-de-escalate-in-the-middle-east\">instincts</a> more than those of <a href=\"http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/176407/tomgram%3A_danny_sjursen%2C_cleaning_house%2C_enabling_war\">his advisers</a>. Secretary of State Pompeo and National Security Adviser Bolton are well-known Iranophobes with an ax to grind. Ditching the Iran Deal was definitely a win for these two. Still, scuttling the JCPOA does not <em>have</em> to mean war.</p>\n<p>Trump eventually saw the invasion and occupation of Iraq for what it was: an unmitigated failure. Let’s hope he applies that instinct and avoids what promises to be an even more costly war with the Islamic Republic.</p>\n<p>Mr. President, hundreds of thousands of us, overstretched veterans of 17 years of perpetual war in the Mid-East, are counting on a new deal.</p>\n<p>One that doesn’t include a new war.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>[<strong>Note:</strong> The views expressed in this article are those of the author, expressed in an unofficial capacity, and do not reflect the official policy or position of the Department of the Army, Department of Defense, or the U.S. government.]</p>\n<p><em><strong>Danny Sjursen</strong> is a fellow at Defense Priorities.

Responding to an Executive Order issued by President Trump last summer, the report promises to shake up the way DoD has managed supply chain vulnerabilities for the past decade.</p>\n<p>“What comes up and is quite alarming … is we have an amazing amount of dependency on China,” Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment Ellen Lord recently told an audience at a defense industry forum. “[They] are sole sources for rare earth minerals, some energetics, different things. This is a problem for us as we move forward.”</p>\n<p><strong>Frankly, this is old news</strong>. A 2013 report from the Alliance for American Manufacturing,<span> </span><em>Remaking American Security</em>, broke new ground by examining more than a dozen different defense industrial base sectors, identifying vulnerabilities to disruption, and recommending mitigation strategies. Some of the report’s warnings were heeded, some of the recommendations were accepted by policymakers, and some of the risks were reduced. However, the lack of urgency to address the problem has lingered amidst a rapidly changing world.</p>\n<p>Still, the undersecretary’s remarks are among the clearest signals to date that previous DoD complacency has changed to bipartisan concern – and that its looming study will lay out clear plans to mitigate them.  </p>\n<p>There is bipartisan support for this effort, but Washington’s approach to this has been unfocused. The House and Senate armed services committees, for instance, haven’t paid nearly enough attention to the maintenance of our defense industrial base, let alone its expansion. They have often instead chipped away at the domestic content requirements that ensure the survival of small- and medium-sized manufacturers whose workers arm our troops. Finding cost savings within a complex bureaucracy is important, but the balance often seems to tilt towards a greater reliance on foreign products as a solution.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the vulnerabilities in our readiness are truly myriad.</p>\n<p>To begin, consider cyber risks, which are perhaps the most immediate and least understood. The Internet of Things upon which our economy, homeland security infrastructure, and defense systems increasingly depend is not only a web of capabilities but susceptibilities. We are just now realizing the scope of the threat, much less doing anything about it. The just-released report from the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (<em>Supply Chain Vulnerabilities from China in U.S. Federal Information and Communications Technology</em>) highlights a critical sector that is vulnerable to Chinese disruption. Now that it has been acknowledged and accepted, we must follow-up with a detailed review of our supply chains in other important defense and homeland security infrastructure sectors.</p>\n<p>Next is the painstaking process of actually mitigating the vulnerabilities of those supply chains. Just last month, for example, DoD banned the sale of cell phones made by Chinese tech giants Huawei and ZTE in military exchanges worldwide. This is a welcome though woefully tardy acknowledgment that such devices put our globally deployed soldiers at risk of being tracked by Chinese back-doors in the phones themselves. Elsewhere, Congress is reviewing investment restrictions of Chinese takeovers of key technology, and President Trump has imposed tariffs on imported steel and aluminum to shore up our production capabilities against a backdrop of predatory trade that has decimated the industry. Again, all are positive steps, but more needs to be done, in a comprehensive whole-of-government manner, to sustain and strengthen America’s capabilities.</p>\n<p>Following that comes the incorporation of mitigation strategies into our strategic planning. That will mean an end to sequestration. When it comes to providing the weapons and equipment for our warriors to defend our country, there is no excuse for privileging profits — or short-term budget relief — over security. It has had a destructive effect on our defense readiness, and in effect has helped create this culture of complacency regarding identifying risks to our defense supply chains.</p>\n<p>The most pressing recommendation, however, is that the weapons and equipment upon which our defense and homeland security infrastructure depend should be made in America.</p>\n<p>This recommendation only now is beginning to be taken seriously, but it should be a default position; when we complacently allow our most implacable strategic competitors to produce the weapons and equipment we need for our defense, we are ultimately introducing doubt to their readiness. We must not cripple our warriors’ ability to fight future battles before those battles even begin.</p>\n<p>In her comments to that defense forum, Under Secretary Lord said the report “will clearly give categories where we are sole-sourced and where we have fragility in the supply chain, and you will also see a round of efforts that we have to repair those fragilities.” I welcome it. A clear-eyed examination at the interagency level of our supply chains was needed yesterday. This report’s release is an important first step. It must then be followed by immediate actions to address the most urgent vulnerabilities. Most important, it must be followed by detailed interagency planning — at the strategic level — to ensure we minimize risks to our defense supply chains’ disruptions in the future.</p>\n<p>As we eagerly await the release of the DoD report, let us not lose sight of the fact that our work to secure our defense supply chains is just the beginning.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><em><strong>Brigadier General Adams (Ret., U.S. Army)</strong> served more than thirty years in command and staff assignments as an Army Aviator, Military Intelligence Officer, and Foreign Area Officer in Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.

The EO900 provides a 0.3° FOV. &#13;\n  </p>&#13;\n<p>The Alticam 14 has been developed in conjunction with HoodTech Vision. &#13;\n  </p>&#13;\n<p>This latest addition to Insitu’s payload family continues the ‘imagery evolution’ Anderson said. Licence plates, facial features and other such objects can now be identified which is a step on from simply tracking a vehicle, as was the case with earlier payload designs. &#13;\n  </p>&#13;\n<p>More specific details regarding the Alticam 14 are to be released in the future. &#13;\n  </p>&#13;\n<p>In addition, Insitu’s partners, Sentient, confirmed that the company is now working on the development of a night version of its <a href=\"https://www.shephardmedia.com/news/uv-online/auvsi-2016-sentient-pushes-ahead-vidar/\">Visual Detection and Ranging (ViDAR)</a> payload and software. &#13;\n  </p>&#13;\n<p>During a live demonstration of the ViDAR-equipped ScanEagle (pictured) at the Centro de Experimentación de El Arenosillo (CEDEA) near Mazagón the solution showed how it is able to operate in a maritime environment, successfully identifying a capsized vessel. &#13;\n  </p>&#13;\n<p>Simon Olsen, director of business development at Sentient, said the company was in advanced development of a night ViDAR but was unable to say when this would be completed. &#13;\n  </p>&#13;\n<p>Olsen said that a lot of customers were interested in the night variant. It would require a separate UAV system however as it would not be able to work on the same platform as the daytime ViDAR, or the payloads would need to be swapped out. &#13;\n  </p>&#13;\n<p>Sentient said that the company already carried out two upgrades a year of its software at Insitu and Olsen added there are ‘growth opportunities galore' with the system.</p>&#13;\n<p>Finally, Logos Technologies is at the final stages of testing its <a href=\"https://www.shephardmedia.com/news/uv-online/auvsi-2017-logos-and-its-redkite-video/\">Redkite wide-area motion imagery (WAMI)</a> sensor, designed for the Insitu Integrator. &#13;\n  </p>&#13;\n<p>Testing will be completed by the summer 2018, according to Alan Murdoch, VP of international programmes at Logos Technologies. Three series of flight tests have been carried out to date. &#13;\n  </p>&#13;\n<p>The final test will be carried out at Insitu’s site in Boradam, Oregon. &#13;\n  </p>&#13;\n<p>Redkite is able to send WAMI to multiple users on the ground who can select real-time and/or historical video feeds within the coverage area and view them on desktop screens, tablets and other mobile devices.&#13;\n  </p>&#13;\n<p>The 11kg payload can cover an area of 12km² at a 0.5 resolution and gather up to one terabyte of data per hour up to eight hours. &#13;\n  </p>&#13;\n<p>The sensor can be used in both land and maritime environments, though Murdoch admitted it works slightly better over land. &#13;\n  </p>&#13;\n<p>‘The littoral area would be its optimal maritime use,’ he added. &#13;\n  </p>&#13;\n<p>Looking ahead Logos has various development projects ongoing including the development of IR sensor of a naval customer as well as the introduction of the BlackKite WAMI payload for night operations. &#13;\n</p></div>\n\n            \n        \n\n        </div><img style=\"height : 1px; width : 1px;\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"https://assets.shephardmedia.com/live/default/media/cache/images/images/article/Scaneagle_with_Vidar/cfbaf01dec144d40fea0f694a5ffd13c.jpg\">","external_url":"https://www.shephardmedia.com/news/uv-online/insitu-and-partners-progress-payload-offerings/","autor":"Shephard Media Latest Articles","published_date":"May 15, 2018 at 10:41PM","image_url":"https://assets.shephardmedia.com/live/default/media/cache/images/images/article/Scaneagle_with_Vidar/cfbaf01dec144d40fea0f694a5ffd13c.jpg","_id":"tVbFp91mI7mb7Cqm"}

The study revealed that the Halvorson could be converted into diesel/electric without mission impact.  </p>&#13;\n<p>The hybrid capability of the converted loader will be demonstrated in 2019.</p>&#13;\n<p>Halvorsen is a diesel-powered, quickly deployable, high-reach mechanised aircraft loader that can transport and lift up to 25,000lbs of cargo and load it onto military aircraft. The hybrid conversion aims to improve energy efficiency, safety, reliability and maintainability. A 20 to 40% improvement in energy efficiency is expected with the conversion.</p>&#13;\n<p>The addition of batteries will enable the operator to charge Halvorsen from the grid. By maximising the use of grid power and battery mode, energy costs and engine run times can be reduced.

The lawsuit also takes issue with Apple’s repair process for faulty keyboards, saying it doesn’t permanently fix problems during the repair process.</p>\n<p>Apple itself has defended its ultra-thin keyboard design, saying that it’s relatively easy for users to clean the keyboard. The company regularly  <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205662\">refers users to this support document</a>, which shows users how to clean underneath their keyboard using a can of compressed air:</p>\n<blockquote><p>If your MacBook (2015 and later) or MacBook Pro (2016 and later) has an unresponsive key, or a key that feels different than the other keys when you press it, follow these steps to clean the keyboard with compressed air.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Many people frustrated with Apple’s butterfly keyboard design are hoping that the company turns things around with the next-generation MacBook lineup. There have been no indications of this in the rumor mill so far, though that’s not to say Apple isn’t hard at work on a solution.</p>\n<p>We ran a <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2017/02/22/apple-butterfly-keyboard-poll/\">similar poll last year</a>, with 43 percent of users saying they liked the new keyboard and 35 percent saying they had reliability issues.
